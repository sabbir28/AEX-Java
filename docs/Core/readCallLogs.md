# ReadCallLogs Class Documentation

The `ReadCallLogs` class provides functionality to read call logs from the device. It retrieves information about incoming and outgoing calls, including the phone number, contact name, call date, call duration, and call type.

## Class Structure

### Constructor

```java
ReadCallLogs(Context context, Activity activity)
```

Initializes a new instance of the `ReadCallLogs` class.

- Parameters:
  - `context`: The application context.
  - `activity`: The activity context.

## Methods

### `readLogs()`

Retrieves call logs from the device.

- Returns:
  - A string containing the retrieved call logs.

## Usage

To use the `ReadCallLogs` class, follow these steps:

1. **Create an instance:**

    ```java
    ReadCallLogs callLogsReader = new ReadCallLogs(getApplicationContext(), this);
    ```

    Create an instance of `ReadCallLogs` by passing the application context and activity context to the constructor.

2. **Read call logs:**

    ```java
    String callLogs = callLogsReader.readLogs();
    ```

    Call the `readLogs()` method to retrieve call logs from the device. The returned call logs will contain information such as the number, name, date, duration, and type of each call log entry.

## Example

Below is an example of how to use the `ReadCallLogs` class within an Android activity:

```java
public class ExampleActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_example);

        // Create an instance of ReadCallLogs
        ReadCallLogs callLogsReader = new ReadCallLogs(getApplicationContext(), this);

        // Read call logs
        String callLogs = callLogsReader.readLogs();

        // Display or process the retrieved call logs as needed
        Log.d("CallLogs", callLogs);
    }
}
```

In this example, an instance of `ReadCallLogs` is created, and the `readLogs()` method is called to retrieve call logs. The call logs are then logged using `Log.d`, but you can adapt this based on your application's requirements.
