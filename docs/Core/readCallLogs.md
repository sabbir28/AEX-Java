# ReadCallLogs Class Documentation

## Overview

The `ReadCallLogs` class provides functionality to read call logs from the device. It allows you to retrieve information about incoming and outgoing calls, including the phone number, contact name, call duration, call type, and call date.

## Constructor

```java
ReadCallLogs(Context context, Activity activity)
```

Initializes a new instance of the `ReadCallLogs` class.

- Parameters:
  - `context`: The application context.
  - `activity`: The activity context.

## Methods

### `readLogs()`

Retrieves call logs from the device.

- Returns:
  - A string containing the retrieved call logs.

## Usage

To use the `ReadCallLogs` class, follow the steps below:

1. **Create an instance:**

    ```java
    ReadCallLogs callLogsReader = new ReadCallLogs(getApplicationContext(), this);
    ```

    Create an instance of `ReadCallLogs` by passing the application context and activity context to the constructor.

2. **Read call logs:**

    ```java
    String callLogs = callLogsReader.readLogs();
    ```

    Call the `readLogs()` method to retrieve call logs from the device. The returned call logs will be in the form of a string, containing information such as the number, name, date, duration, and type of each call log entry.

## Example

```java
public class ExampleActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_example);

        // Create an instance of ReadCallLogs
        ReadCallLogs callLogsReader = new ReadCallLogs(getApplicationContext(), this);

        // Read call logs
        String callLogs = callLogsReader.readLogs();

        // Display or process the retrieved call logs as needed
        Log.d("CallLogs", callLogs);
    }
}
```

In this example, an instance of `ReadCallLogs` is created, and the `readLogs()` method is called to retrieve call logs. The call logs are then logged using `Log.d`, but you can adapt this based on your application's requirements.

Make sure to integrate the `ReadCallLogs` class into your Android project and handle permissions properly.
